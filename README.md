# Feedforward-NN

This is a "from scratch" implementation of a feedforward neural network, written as a personal exercise/learning project to solidify my understanding of neural networks.

The inspiration comes from the tutorial at http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/

This implementation, however, was written to be considerably more flexible, and accepts arbitrary activation functions, network depths, and layer dimensions. 
The network implementation (including initialization, backpropagation, and prediction) are in the neural.py file. 
An example of how to instantiate and use the class is in launcher.py
